SteamCalc
=========

SteamCalc is a corny My First Calculator program to teach me about maths when i add functionality to it (and upgrade from steam power, to perhaps a mini cold fusion reactor one day, which ought to be less clunky and hissing with steam).

Version 0.0.1 will suck. But rewriting it to add floats, more operators and some stuff calculators do that i just dont even know exist yet (not a math person :/ why am i here again?) should be a good project for an educational distraction.
